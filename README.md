# The Gourmet Nomad
This app is the product of everything I've learned across a 17 week period. Okay, maybe not everything, but I have been through the ringer to get this far lol. This was initially a traveler's app for restaurants that are worth visiting in great cities

## Getting Started

This was definitively the most arduous project that I've attempted. Learning Ruby and the overall Journey through this process has shown me many things, not only about coding, but about myself. This project was my capstone and in the end turned out like poo. Though my original laptop crashed, I still managed to get this far in two days. I am tired but grateful for the knowledge that I've received.
